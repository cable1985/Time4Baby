# Time4Baby
Pediatricians, hospitals, and state healthcare agencies recommend tracking newborn care data. The Time4Baby web app, built on a MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack, enables its users to quickly track their babyâ€™s relevant statistics. Diaper changes and feeding data are logged and accessible for later viewing and printing.

The Time4Baby app was built in combination with Jason Watmore's MEAN Stack User Registration and Login Example & Tutorial to create the login screen and account page. The app was deployed using Heroku's free cloud platform service and can be found at time4baby.herokuapp.com.
